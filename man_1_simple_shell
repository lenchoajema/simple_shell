.SH NAME
hsh - Simple Shell: A command line interpreter or shell.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBhsh\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
The hsh (Simple Shell) program is a command line interpreter that allows users to interact with the system by entering commands from the terminal or files. It reads and executes these commands, providing a convenient way to perform various operations.

.SH OVERVIEW
The hsh shell acts as an interface between the user and the operating system. It interprets the commands entered by the user and executes them accordingly. By using the hsh shell, users can navigate through directories, run programs, manipulate files, and perform other system-related tasks.

.SH COMPILATION
To compile the hsh shell, you can use the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) with the specified flags. The example command for compilation is as follows:
.P
.RS
.B $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
.P
.RE
After successful compilation, the shell can be executed by running the following command:
.P
.RS
.B $ ./hsh

.SH BUILTINS
The hsh shell supports two built-in commands:

.B exit
The "exit" command allows users to exit the shell and return to the previous environment.

.B env
The "env" command lists the current environment variables, providing information about the system's configuration.

.SH COMMAND LINE SYNTAX
The hsh shell follows a typical command line syntax where commands are executed in the form of:
.P
.RS
.B $ command [options] [arguments]
.P
.RE
Multiple commands can be executed on a single line by separating them using a semicolon.

.SH REDIRECTION
The hsh shell supports input and output redirection. Users can redirect standard input and output streams using the following symbols:
.P
.RS
.B > : Redirect standard output to a file.
.B >> : Append standard output to a file.
.B < : Redirect standard input from a file.
.P
.RE

.SH PIPES
The hsh shell also allows for command pipelining using the pipe symbol (|). It enables users to send the output of one command as the input to another command.

.SH BACKGROUND EXECUTION
Commands can be executed in the background by adding an ampersand (&) at the end of the command. This allows users to continue using the shell while the command is running in the background.

.SH SEE ALSO
.B Bash(1)
The hsh shell is similar to the Bash shell, which is a widely used command interpreter in Unix-like operating systems.

.SH BUGS
No known bugs have been identified in the hsh shell.
